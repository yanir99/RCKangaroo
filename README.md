RCKangaroo is free and open-source (GPLv3).
This software demonstrates efficient GPU implementation of SOTA Kangaroo method for solving ECDLP. 
It's part #3 of my research, you can find more details here: https://github.com/RetiredC

Discussion thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5517607

<b>Features:</b>

- Lowest K=1.15, it means 1.8 times less required operations compared to classic method with K=2.1, also it means that you need 1.8 times less memory to store DPs.
- Fast, about 8GKeys/s on RTX 4090, 4GKeys/s on RTX 3090.
- Keeps DP overhead as small as possible.
- Supports ranges up to 170 bits.
- Both Windows and Linux are supported.

<b>Limitations:</b>

- No advanced features like networking, saving/loading DPs, etc.

<b>Command line parameters:</b>

<b>-gpu</b>		which GPUs are used, for example, "035" means that GPUs #0, #3 and #5 are used. If not specified, all available GPUs are used. 

<b>-pubkey</b>		public key to solve, both compressed and uncompressed keys are supported. If not specified, software starts in benchmark mode and solves random keys. 

<b>-pubfile</b>		path to a file with multiple public keys and their subtracted decimal offsets. Each line must contain "<public_key> # <decimal_offset>", where the first line has offset 0 for the original public key and the following lines contain keys generated by subtracting the listed value from the original private key. The loader streams entries instead of preloading the entire file, so very large lists begin processing immediately. During solving the program walks the file in order, running wild/tame searches for each entry until one matches, then reports the matched key and restores the original key using the offset. 

<b>-start</b>		start offset of the key, in hex. Mandatory if "-pubkey" or "-pubfile" option is specified. For example, for puzzle #85 start offset is "1000000000000000000000". 

<b>-range</b>		bit range of private the key. Mandatory if "-pubkey" option is specified. For example, for puzzle #85 bit range is "84" (84 bits). Must be in range 32...170. 

<b>-dp</b>		DP bits. Must be in range 14...60. Low DP bits values cause larger DB but reduces DP overhead and vice versa. 

<b>-max</b>		option to limit max number of operations. For example, value 5.5 limits number of operations to 5.5 * 1.15 * sqrt(range), software stops when the limit is reached. 

<b>-tames</b>		filename with tames. If file not found, software generates tames (option "-max" is required) and saves them to the file. If the file is found, software loads tames to speedup solving. The tames file must be generated with the same <b>-range</b> value you use when loading it; mismatched ranges are rejected and the run continues without tames. 

When public key is solved, software displays it and also writes it to "RESULTS.TXT" file. 

Sample command line for puzzle #85:

RCKangaroo.exe -dp 16 -range 84 -start 1000000000000000000000 -pubkey 0329c4574a4fd8c810b7e42a4b398882b381bcd85e40c6883712912d167c83e73a

Sample command to generate tames:

RCKangaroo.exe -dp 16 -range 76 -tames tames76.dat -max 10

Then you can restart software with same parameters to see less K in benchmark mode or add "-tames tames76.dat" to solve some public key in 76-bit range faster.

<b>Tames generation guidance:</b>

- Tames are only practical for moderate ranges. The work grows as 1.15 · 2^(range/2); for a 133-bit window that is roughly 2^66.7 operations even before any multiplier from "-max".
- If you still need to benchmark a 133-bit window, keep the operation cap low (for example, "-max 0.25" to probe the path layout) and use a higher DP value (around 18–20) to keep the DP table size manageable.
- Even at an optimistic 8 GKeys/s, a 133-bit run with "-max 1" would take ~400K days; with "-max 8" it becomes impractical. Consider narrowing the search window instead of attempting full-range tames generation at that size.

<b>Some notes:</b>

Fastest ECDLP solvers will always use SOTA/SOTA+ method, as it's 1.4/1.5 times faster and requires less memory for DPs compared to the best 3-way kangaroos with K=1.6. 
Even if you already have a faster implementation of kangaroo jumps, incorporating SOTA method will improve it further. 
While adding the necessary loop-handling code will cause you to lose about 5–15% of your current speed, the SOTA method itself will provide a 40% performance increase. 
Overall, this translates to roughly a 25% net improvement, which should not be ignored if your goal is to build a truly fast solver.
